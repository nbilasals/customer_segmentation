**Customer Segmentation using Clustering Algorithms**

This project aims to segment customers based on their behavior and demographics. Customers who have been with the company for a long time and have high loyalty are important to retain as they significantly impact the company's success. To achieve this, the project uses clustering algorithms to group customers with similar characteristics together. The research methodology involves data understanding, data preparation, data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. The data used in this project is obtained from Kaggle's "Customer Personality Analysis," which includes customer behavior and demographics. The project applies various clustering algorithms, including K-Means Clustering, DBScan, and Agglomerative Algorithm, to segment customers into groups with similar characteristics.
